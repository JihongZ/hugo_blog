      <description>This simulation study is to show how to do IRT Linking Process using mirt R Package. The simulation data includes 2 forms - Form A and Form B. These 2 forms are simulated based on 2 groups of individual, one group has 0 mean trait, another has 0.25 mean trait. Both groups have same sd.
The means and sds of simulated Form A and B ara:
\[ \theta_{A} = \theta_{B} - 0.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was asked by my friend why should we use Measurement Invariance in real research. Why not just ignore this complex and tedious process? As far I’m concerned, measurement invariance should be widely used if you have large data scale and figure out what’s going on between groups difference. In this post, I want to elaborate some problems in Measurement Invariance: 1) What is measurement invariance 2) why should we care about measuremnet invariance 3) how to do measurement invariance using R Lavaan Package.</description>
